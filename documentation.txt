The YuGuide: Documentation
 
Summary: The YuGuide is a site similar to the Q-Guide allowing users to review different clubs on Harvard’s campus. It was implemented using Django.

How to access the website:
1. Navigate to the project root directory (containing the README and requirements files) and execute “pip install -r requirements.txt” to install necessary dependencies. (See link to install pip if not yet installed)
2. In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the file ‘manage.py’ and execute “python manage.py runserver” to start the Django development server.
3. Access the live website at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
 
Brief summary of website usage:
- When you visit the website for the first time, you should register for an account using the register button at the top of the page.
- After registering, log in with your newfound account. This will direct you to an index of all the clubs available (so far, this index only contains a sample of all the Harvard clubs).
- Clicking on any of these club links on the index page will open up a page with more information about the club, including an opportunity to review the organization at the bottom of the page.
- There also exists a search button with which users can search for clubs by either a keyword in the club name, the club’s abbreviation, or the club genre. Searching in this manner will bring up a table of all the hits for that search query.
 
FAQ:
Why can’t I search with queries that are not full words?
So far, our search only works with queries consisting of either a full word contained in the club name (e.g. “developer”), the club abbreviation (e.g. “d4d”), or the club genre (e.g. “science”). We are actively working on implementing a search mechanism that can search with a more elastic query.
